  content: "You are working on a App called \"Elite\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that\
    \ the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"Elite\"\
    \ as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"Elite\":\n```\nTodo List Functionality:\n\n1. **Add Todo Item**: Users\
    \ can add tasks with details such as task name, description, due date, and priority level. Should there be any specific\
    \ fields related to healthcare activities that need to be included in the task details?\n\n2. **View Todo List**: Display\
    \ a list of tasks for each client, with the ability to sort or filter tasks by status (pending, completed), due date,\
    \ or priority.\n\n3. **Edit Todo Item**: Users can edit the details of an existing task. Are there any restrictions on\
    \ who can edit tasks (e.g., only the user who created the task or any user with access to that client)?\n\n4. **Mark as\
    \ Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed. Should there be an option to revert a task back to pending status?\n\
    \n5. **Delete Todo Item**: Users can delete tasks. Should this be a soft delete (where the task is hidden but not permanently\
    \ removed) or a hard delete (permanently removed)?\n\n6. **Access Control**: Define which roles have access to view and\
    \ manage the Todo lists. Is access to Todo lists based on the client they are assigned to, or can certain roles view all\
    \ clients' Todo lists?\n\n7. **Notifications/Reminders**: Should the system send notifications or reminders for upcoming\
    \ deadlines for tasks? If so, which method(s) should be used (email, SMS, in-app notifications)?\n\nPlease provide details\
    \ on these aspects of the Todo list functionality to ensure the specification fully captures the project requirements.\n\
    Additional info/examples:\n1. The app is built using React.\n2. The app features a login page.\n3. Users can change their\
    \ password.\n4. Upon login, users can see the names and pictures of clients.\n5. Clicking on a client's name or picture\
    \ takes the user to that client's todo list.\n```\n\nHere is a short description of the project architecture:\nThe application\
    \ will have a React front-end for dynamic user interfaces, with Node.js and Express serving as the backend for API requests,\
    \ and MongoDB for the database. Authentication will be handled via session-based login, and the app will provide CRUD\
    \ operations for todo items, along with access control and notifications.\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to\
    \ use for this project:\n\n* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app\
    \ you're building.\n* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version\
    \ such as MongoDB Atlas.\n* express - Express web server for Node\n* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB interactions\n\
    * bcrypt - Library to help hash passwords\n* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express\n* react -\
    \ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces\n* react-dom - React package for working with the DOM\n* react-router-dom\
    \ - DOM bindings for React Router\n* axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js\n* bootstrap - Front-end\
    \ framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\n* dotenv - Module to load environment variables\
    \ from a .env file\n\n\n\nThese files are currently implemented:\n* `.eslintrc.cjs`: Configuration file for ESLint, a\
    \ static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It defines rules for linting\
    \ JavaScript code with a focus on React applications.\n* `.gitignore`: Specifies patterns to exclude files and directories\
    \ from being tracked by Git version control system. It is used to prevent certain files from being committed to the repository.\n\
    * `index.html`: Main entry point for the project. It includes a basic HTML structure with a root div element and a script\
    \ tag importing a JavaScript file named main.jsx using the module type. References: src/main.jsx\n* `package.json`: Standard\
    \ Nodejs package metadata file, specifies dependencies and start scripts. It also specifies that the project is a module.\n\
    * `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite, a fast developer-friendly Javascript bundler/devserver.\n* `public/.gitkeep`:\
    \ (unknown)\n* `src/App.css`: This file defines CSS styles for the root element of the application, setting a maximum\
    \ width, centering it on the page, adding padding, and aligning text to the center.\n* `src/App.jsx`: This file defines\
    \ a functional component named App that renders a heading element with the text 'Elite'. The component is exported as\
    \ the default export. [References: src/App.css]\n* `src/index.css`: This CSS file defines styling rules for the root element,\
    \ body, and h1 elements. It sets font properties for better rendering and layout properties for centering content.\n*\
    \ `src/main.jsx`: This file is the main entry point for a React application. It imports React and ReactDOM to render the\
    \ main App component into the root element of the HTML document. [References: App.jsx, index.css]\n* `src\\assets/.gitkeep`:\
    \ (unknown)\n* `.env`: This file contains a configuration setting for the MongoDB URI to connect to a MongoDB database.\n\
    * `backend/database.js`: This file defines a function to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. It reads the MongoDB\
    \ connection URI from the environment variables using dotenv and then attempts to establish a connection to the database.\
    \ If the connection is successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs an error message and exits the process.\
    \ [References: mongoose.js, dotenv.js]\n* `testDatabaseConnection.js`: This file `testDatabaseConnection.js` is responsible\
    \ for testing the connection to a MongoDB database. It imports the `connectDB` function from the `database.js` file located\
    \ in the `backend` directory and then tests the connection by calling the `connectDB` function. If the connection is successful,\
    \ it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs an error message. [References: backend/database.js]\n* `backend/server.js`:\
    \ This file sets up an Express server that listens on a specified port, handles a GET request to '/api/ping' by responding\
    \ with a JSON object containing a success message, and includes error handling middleware to log errors and send a generic\
    \ error response. [References: express.js, dotenv.js]\nHere are the relevant files:\n---START_OF_FILES---\n**\\.env**\

    \ development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Implement the MongoDB connection using Mongoose in a new file\
    \ named `database.js` in the `backend` folder. In this file, use dotenv to load environment variables and mongoose to\
    \ connect to MongoDB. The connection string should be stored in a `.env` file at the root of the project for security\
    \ reasons. This task includes handling connection errors and logging successful database connection messages to the console.\n\
    \n2. Set up the Express server in a file named `server.js` in the `backend` folder. This server should import Express\
    \ and initialize it to listen on a port specified in the `.env` file. The server should have a simple GET route `/api/ping`\
    \ that returns a JSON response `{ success: true, message: 'Pong' }` to test if the server is running. Use dotenv to load\
    \ the port from the `.env` file.\n\n3. Create the user authentication system in the `backend` folder. This system includes\
    \ a model for users in `models/userModel.js`, using Mongoose schema that contains fields for username, password (hashed),\
    \ and roles. Implement password hashing in the user model's `pre-save` hook using bcrypt. Also, set up routes for user\
    \ registration and login in a new file `routes/authRoutes.js`, utilizing express-session for session management.\n\n4.\
    \ Develop the frontend login page using React. In the `src` folder, create a new component `Login.jsx` that includes form\
    \ inputs for username and password, and a submit button. Use Axios to send a POST request to the backend's login route\
    \ when the form is submitted. Handle authentication feedback (success/error) and redirect to the main Todo List page upon\
    \ successful login.\n\n5. Implement the Todo List functionality in the backend. This includes creating a Todo model in\
    \ `models/todoModel.js` with fields for task name, description, due date, priority, status, and associated client ID.\
    \ Create a new file `routes/todoRoutes.js` for the Todo-related routes (CRUD operations). Ensure these routes include\
    \ middleware for authentication and authorization checks based on user roles and client assignments.\n\n6. Build the frontend\
    \ Todo List interface in React within the `src` folder. Create components `TodoList.jsx` and `TodoItem.jsx` for displaying\
    \ the list of tasks and individual tasks, respectively. These components should fetch and display data from the backend,\
    \ support sorting/filtering tasks, and provide UI elements for marking tasks as completed and deleting tasks. Use Axios\
    \ for API requests and Bootstrap for styling.\n\n7. Add the ability for users to add and edit Todo items via modal forms\
    \ in the frontend. Create two new components, `AddTodoModal.jsx` and `EditTodoModal.jsx`, which include form inputs for\
    \ task name, description, due date, and priority level. These components should handle form submissions by sending POST\
    \ and PUT requests to the backend's corresponding Todo routes. Integrate these modals into the `TodoList.jsx` component.\n\
    \n8. Implement access control in both frontend and backend. In the backend, enhance the authentication middleware to verify\
    \ user roles and permissions before allowing access to specific routes. In the frontend, conditionally render UI components\
    \ based on the user's role and permissions (e.g., editing and deleting Todo items). This task includes updating the React\
    \ Router setup in `App.jsx` to protect certain routes based on user authentication and role.\n\n9. Set up notifications\
    \ for upcoming Todo item deadlines in the backend. Create a script in the `backend` folder that periodically checks for\
    \ Todo items nearing their due dates and sends notifications via email. Utilize a library like Nodemailer for email sending,\
    \ and configure it to use SMTP with credentials stored in the `.env` file. The frequency of the checks and the definition\
    \ of 'upcoming' (e.g., within 24 hours) should be configurable.\n\n10. Finalize the project by ensuring all environment\
    \ variables are properly configured in the `.env` file, including database connection strings, server port, session secret,\
    \ and email SMTP settings. Check that the frontend and backend are fully integrated, with the frontend correctly displaying\
    \ data from the backend and handling user interactions. This task also includes a final review of the codebase for consistency,\
    \ readability, and adherence to best practices.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #3 with the following description:\n\
    ```\nCreate the user authentication system in the `backend` folder. This system includes a model for users in `models/userModel.js`,\
    \ using Mongoose schema that contains fields for username, password (hashed), and roles. Implement password hashing in\
    \ the user model's `pre-save` hook using bcrypt. Also, set up routes for user registration and login in a new file `routes/authRoutes.js`,\
    \ utilizing express-session for session management.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on\
    \ them.\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and\
    \ all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty folder where\
    \ I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Pay attention to file\
    \ paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for\
    \ example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will\
    \ be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: When\
    \ creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with\
    \ the best practices and coding style of the language.\n\nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them,\
    \ so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never\
    \ code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nYou must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies\
    \ need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled\
    \ as \"Human Intervention\" and explain what the human needs to do.\nAvoid using \"Human Intervention\" if possible. You\
    \ should NOT use \"Human Intervention\" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use \"\
    Human Intervention\" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the\
    \ steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.\n\nHere are a few examples when and how to use \"Human Intervention\"\
    :\n------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------\nHere is an example of good response for the\
    \ situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:\n\n* \"Human Intervention\"\n\"\
    1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.\n2. Verify Facebook\
    \ API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.\n3. Use REST client\
    \ tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.\n4. Check the Facebook API's status page for\
    \ any reported downtime or service issues.\n5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the\
    \ issue.\"\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------\n\n------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------\n\
    Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:\n\
    \n* \"Human Intervention\"\n\"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the\
    \ following:\n1. Log in to your Gmail account.\n2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.\n3. Scroll down to 'Less\
    \ secure app access' and turn it on.\n4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in\
    \ again)\n5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you\u2019re using.\n6. Click 'Generate'.\nThen, use\
    \ your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file.\"\n------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------\n\
    \n------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------\nHere is an example when there are issues with\
    \ writing to the MongoDB connection:\n\n* \"Human Intervention\"\n\"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write\
    \ permissions, not just read-only access.\n2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to\
    \ database.\n3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions.\"\n------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible\
    \ and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "To implement the user authentication system, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Required Dependencies**\nFirst,\
    \ you'll need to install several packages required for authentication, hashing passwords, and session management.\n\n\
    ```bash\nnpm install bcrypt mongoose express-session\n```\n\n2. **Create the User Model**\nYou need to define the user\
    \ model with fields for username, password, and roles. This model will also include password hashing before saving the\
    \ user data.\n\nFile: `./backend/models/userModel.js`\n\n```javascript\nimport mongoose from 'mongoose';\nimport bcrypt\
    \ from 'bcrypt';\n\nconst userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n\
    \    unique: true,\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n  },\n  roles: [{\n    type: String,\n\
    \    enum: ['admin', 'user'],\n    default: 'user',\n  }],\n});\n\n// Hash password before saving\nuserSchema.pre('save',\
    \ async function(next) {\n  if (this.isModified('password') || this.isNew) {\n    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);\n\
    \    const hash = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);\n    this.password = hash;\n  }\n  next();\n});\n\nconst User\
    \ = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);\n\nexport default User;\n```\n\n3. **Set Up Authentication Routes**\nNext, you'll\
    \ create routes for user registration and login, utilizing express-session for session management.\n\nFile: `./backend/routes/authRoutes.js`\n\
    \n```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport bcrypt from 'bcrypt';\nimport User from '../models/userModel.js';\n\
    import expressSession from 'express-session';\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\n// Initialize express-session\nrouter.use(expressSession({\n\
    \  secret: 'secret',\n  resave: false,\n  saveUninitialized: false,\n}));\n\n// Registration route\nrouter.post('/register',\
    \ async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { username, password, roles } = req.body;\n    const user = new User({ username,\
    \ password, roles });\n    await user.save();\n    res.status(201).send('User registered successfully');\n  } catch (error)\
    \ {\n    res.status(500).send(error.message);\n  }\n});\n\n// Login route\nrouter.post('/login', async (req, res) => {\n\
    \  try {\n    const { username, password } = req.body;\n    const user = await User.findOne({ username });\n    if (!user)\
    \ {\n      return res.status(401).send('Authentication failed: User not found.');\n    }\n    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password,\
    \ user.password);\n    if (isMatch) {\n      req.session.user = user;\n      res.status(200).send('Logged in successfully');\n\
    \    } else {\n      res.status(401).send('Authentication failed: Incorrect password.');\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n\
    \    res.status(500).send(error.message);\n  }\n});\n\nexport default router;\n```\n\n4. **Integrate Authentication Routes\
    \ into the Server**\nFinally, you need to import and use the authentication routes in your Express server.\n\nFile: `./backend/server.js`\n\
    \nAdd these lines before the error handling middleware:\n\n```javascript\nimport authRoutes from './routes/authRoutes.js';\n\
    \n// Other imports and server setup...\n\n// Use routes\napp.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);\n\n// Existing app.listen()\
    \ and error handling middleware...\n```\n\n5. **Update the `.env` file**\nFor security and configuration, ensure your\
    \ `.env` file includes a secret key for session management.\n\nAdd this line to your `.env` file:\n\n```\nSESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key_here\n\
    ```\nReplace `your_secret_key_here` with a strong, random string to be used as the secret for express-session.\n\nThese\
    \ steps will set up a basic user authentication system with registration and login functionality, storing hashed passwords,\
    \ and managing user sessions."

  content: 'How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?


    Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe
    what the expected response is.


    **IMPORTANT**


    Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:


    1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don''t want the user to have to think anything through but rather that
    they just follow your instructions.

    2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser.
    In case you can''t do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command
    that the user can just run.

    3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.

    4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need
    to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you''re in the project directory")

    5. The user is using Windows, so the commands must run on that operating system

    6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don''t ask user to install or run any
    software other than the app they''re testing.

    7. Don''t ask the user to test things which aren''t implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn''t
    exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn''t implemented yet)


    Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!


    Here is an example output with a few user steps:

    ---example---

    ### Step 1

    Action: Start the server using `npm start`

    Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar


    ### Step 2

    Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/

    Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form


    ### Step 3

    Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form

    Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown

    ---end_of_example---


    If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE'
response: '### Step 1

  Action: Start the server by running `npm run dev` in the terminal.

  Expected result: You should see messages indicating the server is running, such as "Server is running on port XXXX" and
  "Database connected successfully".


  ### Step 2

  Action: Run the following cURL command to test the user registration endpoint:


  ```bash

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\": \"testUser\",
  \"password\": \"password123\", \"roles\": [\"user\"]}"

  ```

  Expected result: You should receive a response saying "User registered successfully".


  ### Step 3

  Action: Run the following cURL command to test the user login endpoint with the credentials you just registered:


  ```bash

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\": \"testUser\", \"password\":
  \"password123\"}"

  ```

  Expected result: You should receive a response saying "Logged in successfully".'
