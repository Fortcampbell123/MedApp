    You write modular, well-organized code split across files that are not too big, so that the codebase is maintainable.
    You include proper error handling and logging for your clean, readable, production-level quality code.


    Your job is to implement tasks assigned by your tech lead, following task implementation instructions.'

  content: "You are working on a App called \"Elite\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that\
    \ the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"Elite\"\
    \ as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"Elite\":\n```\nTodo List Functionality:\n\n1. **Add Todo Item**: Users\
    \ can add tasks with details such as task name, description, due date, and priority level. Should there be any specific\
    \ fields related to healthcare activities that need to be included in the task details?\n\n2. **View Todo List**: Display\
    \ a list of tasks for each client, with the ability to sort or filter tasks by status (pending, completed), due date,\
    \ or priority.\n\n3. **Edit Todo Item**: Users can edit the details of an existing task. Are there any restrictions on\
    \ who can edit tasks (e.g., only the user who created the task or any user with access to that client)?\n\n4. **Mark as\
    \ Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed. Should there be an option to revert a task back to pending status?\n\
    \n5. **Delete Todo Item**: Users can delete tasks. Should this be a soft delete (where the task is hidden but not permanently\
    \ removed) or a hard delete (permanently removed)?\n\n6. **Access Control**: Define which roles have access to view and\
    \ manage the Todo lists. Is access to Todo lists based on the client they are assigned to, or can certain roles view all\
    \ clients' Todo lists?\n\n7. **Notifications/Reminders**: Should the system send notifications or reminders for upcoming\
    \ deadlines for tasks? If so, which method(s) should be used (email, SMS, in-app notifications)?\n\nPlease provide details\
    \ on these aspects of the Todo list functionality to ensure the specification fully captures the project requirements.\n\
    Additional info/examples:\n1. The app is built using React.\n2. The app features a login page.\n3. Users can change their\
    \ password.\n4. Upon login, users can see the names and pictures of clients.\n5. Clicking on a client's name or picture\
    \ takes the user to that client's todo list.\n```\n\nHere is a short description of the project architecture:\nThe application\
    \ will have a React front-end for dynamic user interfaces, with Node.js and Express serving as the backend for API requests,\
    \ and MongoDB for the database. Authentication will be handled via session-based login, and the app will provide CRUD\
    \ operations for todo items, along with access control and notifications.\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to\
    \ use for this project:\n\n* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app\
    \ you're building.\n* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version\
    \ such as MongoDB Atlas.\n* express - Express web server for Node\n* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB interactions\n\
    * bcrypt - Library to help hash passwords\n* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express\n* react -\
    \ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces\n* react-dom - React package for working with the DOM\n* react-router-dom\
    \ - DOM bindings for React Router\n* axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js\n* bootstrap - Front-end\
    \ framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\n* dotenv - Module to load environment variables\
    \ from a .env file\n\n\n\nThese files are currently implemented:\n* `.eslintrc.cjs`: Configuration file for ESLint, a\
    \ static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It defines rules for linting\
    \ JavaScript code with a focus on React applications.\n* `.gitignore`: Specifies patterns to exclude files and directories\
    \ from being tracked by Git version control system. It is used to prevent certain files from being committed to the repository.\n\
    * `index.html`: Main entry point for the project. It includes a basic HTML structure with a root div element and a script\
    \ tag importing a JavaScript file named main.jsx using the module type. References: src/main.jsx\n* `package.json`: Standard\
    \ Nodejs package metadata file, specifies dependencies and start scripts. It also specifies that the project is a module.\n\
    * `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite, a fast developer-friendly Javascript bundler/devserver.\n* `public/.gitkeep`:\
    \ (unknown)\n* `src/App.css`: This file defines CSS styles for the root element of the application, setting a maximum\
    \ width, centering it on the page, adding padding, and aligning text to the center.\n* `src/App.jsx`: This file defines\
    \ a functional component named App that renders a heading element with the text 'Elite'. The component is exported as\
    \ the default export. [References: src/App.css]\n* `src/index.css`: This CSS file defines styling rules for the root element,\
    \ body, and h1 elements. It sets font properties for better rendering and layout properties for centering content.\n*\
    \ `src/main.jsx`: This file is the main entry point for a React application. It imports React and ReactDOM to render the\
    \ main App component into the root element of the HTML document. [References: App.jsx, index.css]\n* `src\\assets/.gitkeep`:\
    \ (unknown)\n* `.env`: This file contains a configuration setting for the MongoDB URI to connect to a MongoDB database.\n\
    * `backend/database.js`: This file defines a function to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. It reads the MongoDB\
    \ connection URI from the environment variables using dotenv and then attempts to establish a connection to the database.\
    \ If the connection is successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs an error message and exits the process.\

    ```\n\n---END_OF_FILES---\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Implement the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose in a new file named `database.js` in the `backend` folder. In this file, use dotenv to load\
    \ environment variables and mongoose to connect to MongoDB. The connection string should be stored in a `.env` file at\
    \ the root of the project for security reasons. This task includes handling connection errors and logging successful database\
    \ connection messages to the console.\n\n2. Set up the Express server in a file named `server.js` in the `backend` folder.\
    \ This server should import Express and initialize it to listen on a port specified in the `.env` file. The server should\
    \ have a simple GET route `/api/ping` that returns a JSON response `{ success: true, message: 'Pong' }` to test if the\
    \ server is running. Use dotenv to load the port from the `.env` file.\n\n3. Create the user authentication system in\
    \ the `backend` folder. This system includes a model for users in `models/userModel.js`, using Mongoose schema that contains\
    \ fields for username, password (hashed), and roles. Implement password hashing in the user model's `pre-save` hook using\
    \ bcrypt. Also, set up routes for user registration and login in a new file `routes/authRoutes.js`, utilizing express-session\
    \ for session management.\n\n4. Develop the frontend login page using React. In the `src` folder, create a new component\
    \ `Login.jsx` that includes form inputs for username and password, and a submit button. Use Axios to send a POST request\
    \ to the backend's login route when the form is submitted. Handle authentication feedback (success/error) and redirect\
    \ to the main Todo List page upon successful login.\n\n5. Implement the Todo List functionality in the backend. This includes\
    \ creating a Todo model in `models/todoModel.js` with fields for task name, description, due date, priority, status, and\
    \ associated client ID. Create a new file `routes/todoRoutes.js` for the Todo-related routes (CRUD operations). Ensure\
    \ these routes include middleware for authentication and authorization checks based on user roles and client assignments.\n\
    \n6. Build the frontend Todo List interface in React within the `src` folder. Create components `TodoList.jsx` and `TodoItem.jsx`\
    \ for displaying the list of tasks and individual tasks, respectively. These components should fetch and display data\
    \ from the backend, support sorting/filtering tasks, and provide UI elements for marking tasks as completed and deleting\
    \ tasks. Use Axios for API requests and Bootstrap for styling.\n\n7. Add the ability for users to add and edit Todo items\
    \ via modal forms in the frontend. Create two new components, `AddTodoModal.jsx` and `EditTodoModal.jsx`, which include\
    \ form inputs for task name, description, due date, and priority level. These components should handle form submissions\
    \ by sending POST and PUT requests to the backend's corresponding Todo routes. Integrate these modals into the `TodoList.jsx`\
    \ component.\n\n8. Implement access control in both frontend and backend. In the backend, enhance the authentication middleware\
    \ to verify user roles and permissions before allowing access to specific routes. In the frontend, conditionally render\
    \ UI components based on the user's role and permissions (e.g., editing and deleting Todo items). This task includes updating\
    \ the React Router setup in `App.jsx` to protect certain routes based on user authentication and role.\n\n9. Set up notifications\
    \ for upcoming Todo item deadlines in the backend. Create a script in the `backend` folder that periodically checks for\
    \ Todo items nearing their due dates and sends notifications via email. Utilize a library like Nodemailer for email sending,\
    \ and configure it to use SMTP with credentials stored in the `.env` file. The frequency of the checks and the definition\
    \ of 'upcoming' (e.g., within 24 hours) should be configurable.\n\n10. Finalize the project by ensuring all environment\
    \ variables are properly configured in the `.env` file, including database connection strings, server port, session secret,\
    \ and email SMTP settings. Check that the frontend and backend are fully integrated, with the frontend correctly displaying\
    \ data from the backend and handling user interactions. This task also includes a final review of the codebase for consistency,\
    \ readability, and adherence to best practices.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n\
    ```\nSet up the Express server in a file named `server.js` in the `backend` folder. This server should import Express\
    \ and initialize it to listen on a port specified in the `.env` file. The server should have a simple GET route `/api/ping`\
    \ that returns a JSON response `{ success: true, message: 'Pong' }` to test if the server is running. Use dotenv to load\
    \ the port from the `.env` file.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\n\nNow, tell\
    \ me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that\
    \ need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing\
    \ files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Pay attention to file paths: if the command\
    \ or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile`\
    \ instead of `/somefile`).\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically\
    \ - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: When creating and naming new\
    \ files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and\
    \ coding style of the language.\n\nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important\
    \ that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you\
    \ install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nYou must not\
    \ tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If\
    \ there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as \"Human Intervention\"\
    \ and explain what the human needs to do.\nAvoid using \"Human Intervention\" if possible. You should NOT use \"Human\
    \ Intervention\" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use \"Human Intervention\" to\
    \ ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished -\
    \ no need to ask the user now.\n\nHere are a few examples when and how to use \"Human Intervention\":\n------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------\n\
    Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not\
    \ working:\n\n* \"Human Intervention\"\n\"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters,\
    \ or authentication.\n2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly\
    \ implemented.\n3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.\n4. Check the\
    \ Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.\n5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different\
    \ environment to isolate the issue.\"\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------\n\n------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------\n\
    Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:\n\
    \n* \"Human Intervention\"\n\"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the\
    \ following:\n1. Log in to your Gmail account.\n2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.\n3. Scroll down to 'Less\
    \ secure app access' and turn it on.\n4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in\
    \ again)\n5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you\u2019re using.\n6. Click 'Generate'.\nThen, use\
    \ your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file.\"\n------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------\n\
    \n------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------\nHere is an example when there are issues with\
    \ writing to the MongoDB connection:\n\n* \"Human Intervention\"\n\"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write\
    \ permissions, not just read-only access.\n2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to\
    \ database.\n3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions.\"\n------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible\
    \ and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "To implement task #2, we need to set up the Express server with a simple GET route. Here's the step-by-step guide\
    \ to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Express**: First, we need to ensure Express is installed as it's crucial for setting\
    \ up the server.\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\n2. **Install dotenv**: Although it's already installed according\
    \ to the package.json, ensure dotenv is installed to use environment variables.\n```bash\nnpm install dotenv\n```\n\n\
    3. **Create the server file**: We'll write the server setup code in `./backend/server.js`.\n\n**./backend/server.js**:\n\
    ```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv';\n\n// Load environment variables from .env\
    \ file\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001; // Fallback to 3001 if PORT\
    \ is not defined\n\napp.get('/api/ping', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Pong' });\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT,\
    \ () => {\n    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n- Imports\
    \ the necessary modules (`express` and `dotenv`).\n- Loads the environment variables from the `.env` file.\n- Initializes\
    \ an Express application.\n- Defines a GET route `/api/ping` that responds with a JSON object.\n- Starts the server on\
    \ the port specified in the `.env` file or defaults to port 3001.\n\n4. **Update the .env file**: Ensure the .env file\
    \ has the PORT variable defined for the Express server to use.\n\n**./.env** (Add the following line):\n```\nPORT=8080\n\
    ```\n\nNote: Choose a port other than 5000 as specified in the instructions.\n\n5. **Run the server**: Finally, start\
    \ the server to ensure everything is set up correctly.\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis command assumes there's a script\
    \ in `package.json` named `dev` that starts the server, usually with `node ./backend/server.js` or using a tool like nodemon\
    \ for development.\n\nAfter running the server, you can test the `/api/ping` endpoint using a browser or a tool like Postman\
    \ to get a response `{ success: true, message: 'Pong' }`."

    As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.


    When reviewing the code changes, apply these principles to decide on each hunk:

    - Apply: Approve and integrate the hunk into our core codebase if it accurately delivers the intended functionality or
    enhancement, aligning with our project objectives. This action confirms the change is beneficial and meets our quality
    standards.

    - Ignore: Use this option sparingly, only when you''re certain the entire hunk is incorrect or will introduce errors (logical,
    syntax, etc.) that could negatively impact the project. Ignoring means the hunk will be completely removed. This should
    be reserved for cases where the inclusion of the code is definitively more harmful than its absence. Emphasize careful
    consideration before choosing ''Ignore.'' It''s crucial for situations where the hunk''s removal is the only option to
    prevent significant issues. Otherwise, ''Rework'' might be the better choice to ensure the code''s integrity and functionality.

    - Rework: Suggest this option if the concept behind the change is valid and necessary but is implemented in a way that
    introduces problems. This indicates a need for a revision of the hunk to refine its integration without fully discarding
    the underlying idea.


    When deciding what should be done with the hunk you are currently reviewing, pick an option that most reviewers of your
    skill would choose. Your decisions have to be consistent.


    Keep in mind you''re just reviewing current file. You don''t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages
    installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.


    Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that''s
    not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions
    break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only
    on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don''t ask for a rework just because of logging
    or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not
    be the best practice, if it''s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break
    something.


    The developer that wrote this is sometimes sloppy and has could have deleted some parts of the code that contain important
    functionality and should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review.'
