  content: "You are working on a App called \"Elite\" and your job is to review changes made.\n\nHere is a high level description\
    \ of \"Elite\":\n```\nTodo List Functionality:\n\n1. **Add Todo Item**: Users can add tasks with details such as task\
    \ name, description, due date, and priority level. Should there be any specific fields related to healthcare activities\
    \ that need to be included in the task details?\n\n2. **View Todo List**: Display a list of tasks for each client, with\
    \ the ability to sort or filter tasks by status (pending, completed), due date, or priority.\n\n3. **Edit Todo Item**:\
    \ Users can edit the details of an existing task. Are there any restrictions on who can edit tasks (e.g., only the user\
    \ who created the task or any user with access to that client)?\n\n4. **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.\
    \ Should there be an option to revert a task back to pending status?\n\n5. **Delete Todo Item**: Users can delete tasks.\
    \ Should this be a soft delete (where the task is hidden but not permanently removed) or a hard delete (permanently removed)?\n\
    \n6. **Access Control**: Define which roles have access to view and manage the Todo lists. Is access to Todo lists based\
    \ on the client they are assigned to, or can certain roles view all clients' Todo lists?\n\n7. **Notifications/Reminders**:\
    \ Should the system send notifications or reminders for upcoming deadlines for tasks? If so, which method(s) should be\
    \ used (email, SMS, in-app notifications)?\n\nPlease provide details on these aspects of the Todo list functionality to\
    \ ensure the specification fully captures the project requirements.\nAdditional info/examples:\n1. The app is built using\
    \ React.\n2. The app features a login page.\n3. Users can change their password.\n4. Upon login, users can see the names\
    \ and pictures of clients.\n5. Clicking on a client's name or picture takes the user to that client's todo list.\n```\n\
    \nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Implement the\
    \ MongoDB connection using Mongoose in a new file named `database.js` in the `backend` folder. In this file, use dotenv\
    \ to load environment variables and mongoose to connect to MongoDB. The connection string should be stored in a `.env`\
    \ file at the root of the project for security reasons. This task includes handling connection errors and logging successful\
    \ database connection messages to the console.\n\n2. Set up the Express server in a file named `server.js` in the `backend`\
    \ folder. This server should import Express and initialize it to listen on a port specified in the `.env` file. The server\
    \ should have a simple GET route `/api/ping` that returns a JSON response `{ success: true, message: 'Pong' }` to test\
    \ if the server is running. Use dotenv to load the port from the `.env` file.\n\n3. Create the user authentication system\
    \ in the `backend` folder. This system includes a model for users in `models/userModel.js`, using Mongoose schema that\
    \ contains fields for username, password (hashed), and roles. Implement password hashing in the user model's `pre-save`\
    \ hook using bcrypt. Also, set up routes for user registration and login in a new file `routes/authRoutes.js`, utilizing\
    \ express-session for session management.\n\n4. Develop the frontend login page using React. In the `src` folder, create\
    \ a new component `Login.jsx` that includes form inputs for username and password, and a submit button. Use Axios to send\
    \ a POST request to the backend's login route when the form is submitted. Handle authentication feedback (success/error)\
    \ and redirect to the main Todo List page upon successful login.\n\n5. Implement the Todo List functionality in the backend.\
    \ This includes creating a Todo model in `models/todoModel.js` with fields for task name, description, due date, priority,\
    \ status, and associated client ID. Create a new file `routes/todoRoutes.js` for the Todo-related routes (CRUD operations).\
    \ Ensure these routes include middleware for authentication and authorization checks based on user roles and client assignments.\n\
    \n6. Build the frontend Todo List interface in React within the `src` folder. Create components `TodoList.jsx` and `TodoItem.jsx`\
    \ for displaying the list of tasks and individual tasks, respectively. These components should fetch and display data\
    \ from the backend, support sorting/filtering tasks, and provide UI elements for marking tasks as completed and deleting\
    \ tasks. Use Axios for API requests and Bootstrap for styling.\n\n7. Add the ability for users to add and edit Todo items\
    \ via modal forms in the frontend. Create two new components, `AddTodoModal.jsx` and `EditTodoModal.jsx`, which include\
    \ form inputs for task name, description, due date, and priority level. These components should handle form submissions\
    \ by sending POST and PUT requests to the backend's corresponding Todo routes. Integrate these modals into the `TodoList.jsx`\
    \ component.\n\n8. Implement access control in both frontend and backend. In the backend, enhance the authentication middleware\
    \ to verify user roles and permissions before allowing access to specific routes. In the frontend, conditionally render\
    \ UI components based on the user's role and permissions (e.g., editing and deleting Todo items). This task includes updating\
    \ the React Router setup in `App.jsx` to protect certain routes based on user authentication and role.\n\n9. Set up notifications\
    \ for upcoming Todo item deadlines in the backend. Create a script in the `backend` folder that periodically checks for\
    \ Todo items nearing their due dates and sends notifications via email. Utilize a library like Nodemailer for email sending,\
    \ and configure it to use SMTP with credentials stored in the `.env` file. The frequency of the checks and the definition\
    \ of 'upcoming' (e.g., within 24 hours) should be configurable.\n\n10. Finalize the project by ensuring all environment\
    \ variables are properly configured in the `.env` file, including database connection strings, server port, session secret,\
    \ and email SMTP settings. Check that the frontend and backend are fully integrated, with the frontend correctly displaying\
    \ data from the backend and handling user interactions. This task also includes a final review of the codebase for consistency,\
    \ readability, and adherence to best practices.\n\n```\nYou are currently working on, and have to focus only on, this\
    \ task:\n```\nSet up the Express server in a file named `server.js` in the `backend` folder. This server should import\
    \ Express and initialize it to listen on a port specified in the `.env` file. The server should have a simple GET route\
    \ `/api/ping` that returns a JSON response `{ success: true, message: 'Pong' }` to test if the server is running. Use\
    \ dotenv to load the port from the `.env` file.\n```\n\nA part of the app is already finished.\nThese files are currently\
    \ implemented:\n* `.eslintrc.cjs`: Configuration file for ESLint, a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic\
    \ patterns found in JavaScript code. It defines rules for linting JavaScript code with a focus on React applications.\n\
    * `.gitignore`: Specifies patterns to exclude files and directories from being tracked by Git version control system.\
    \ It is used to prevent certain files from being committed to the repository.\n* `index.html`: Main entry point for the\
    \ project. It includes a basic HTML structure with a root div element and a script tag importing a JavaScript file named\
    \ main.jsx using the module type. References: src/main.jsx\n* `package.json`: Standard Nodejs package metadata file, specifies\
    \ dependencies and start scripts. It also specifies that the project is a module.\n* `vite.config.js`: Configuration file\
    \ for Vite, a fast developer-friendly Javascript bundler/devserver.\n* `public/.gitkeep`: (unknown)\n* `src/App.css`:\
    \ This file defines CSS styles for the root element of the application, setting a maximum width, centering it on the page,\
    \ adding padding, and aligning text to the center.\n* `src/App.jsx`: This file defines a functional component named App\
    \ that renders a heading element with the text 'Elite'. The component is exported as the default export. [References:\
    \ src/App.css]\n* `src/index.css`: This CSS file defines styling rules for the root element, body, and h1 elements. It\
    \ sets font properties for better rendering and layout properties for centering content.\n* `src/main.jsx`: This file\
    \ is the main entry point for a React application. It imports React and ReactDOM to render the main App component into\
    \ the root element of the HTML document. [References: App.jsx, index.css]\n* `src\\assets/.gitkeep`: (unknown)\n* `.env`:\
    \ This file contains a configuration setting for the MongoDB URI to connect to a MongoDB database.\n* `backend/database.js`:\
    \ This file defines a function to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. It reads the MongoDB connection URI from\
    \ the environment variables using dotenv and then attempts to establish a connection to the database. If the connection\
    \ is successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs an error message and exits the process. [References: mongoose.js,\
    \ dotenv.js]\n* `testDatabaseConnection.js`: This file `testDatabaseConnection.js` is responsible for testing the connection\
    \ to a MongoDB database. It imports the `connectDB` function from the `database.js` file located in the `backend` directory\
    \ and then tests the connection by calling the `connectDB` function. If the connection is successful, it logs a success\
    \ message; otherwise, it logs an error message. [References: backend/database.js]\n* `backend/server.js`: This file sets\
    \ up an Express server that listens on a specified port, handles a GET request to '/api/ping' by responding with a JSON\
    \ object containing a success message, and includes error handling middleware to log errors and send a generic error response.\

    \ adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.\n\n\
    Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.\nIn this review, your goal\
    \ is to check:\n1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.\n2. If new files or functions\
    \ are created but never called or used.\n3. If there is some \"dead code\" that should be removed.\n4. If there is some\
    \ duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.\n\nIf everything is ok respond\
    \ only with \"DONE\" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything\
    \ is ok, respond just with \"DONE\".\n\nIf you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.\n\
    \nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps\
    \ before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should\
    \ never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Pay attention to file paths: if the command or\
    \ argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile`\
    \ instead of `/somefile`)."
response: DONE
